### Hi there 👋

<!--
**guanhaibin/guanhaibin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🧬🔬I’m a biomedical data analyst and data scientist by day, and a data visualization by night. My superpower? Still training myself to translate complex high-througput biomedical data into sparkling, comprehensible insights with machine leanring.  Bioinformatics is indeed fascinating.
- 🧰 
**Languages I Speak:** Python, R, MATLAB, HTML, LaTeX. Yes, I even dream in code sometimes.
**Gadgets & Gizmos:** AWS, MPI, Docker, QIIME2, XCMS, CAMERA, PICRUSt, Karen. My digital Swiss Army knife.
**Expertise:** Machine Learning, Data Science, Biostatistics, Bioinformatics. Basically, if it involves data and science, I'm your person.
- Fun Facts and Interests 🎯 
- **Metabolomics:** Because tiny molecules make a big difference. Genomics tell you what you might have while metabolomics tell you what you do have!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more reliable untargeted metabolomics data preprocessing workflow; mixture analysis 
- 🤔 I’m still looking for help with multi-omics analysis strategies
- When I'm not decoding the secrets of the small molcules, you can find me perfecting my data visualizations, or just visualizations, love 3d modeling on Blender.


I'm always open to collaboration and discussions, so don't hesitate to reach out!
